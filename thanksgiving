Hi Alex,
Hope you're doing well! Wishing you a very happy Thanksgiving and holiday season. I really appreciate the opportunities we had to work together last year and again recently—it was great collaborating with you.

Message for Claire

Hi Claire,
Happy Thanksgiving and happy holidays! I wanted to say thank you for the opportunity to work with you last year on the KEW Power BI dashboards and data extraction work—your responsiveness and support meant a lot. Even though we didn’t get a chance to work together this year (and despite all my follow-ups!), you were always kind and helpful. I truly appreciate that. Wishing you a warm holiday season, and hopefully we can collaborate again soon!
